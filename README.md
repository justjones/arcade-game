Udacity Project - Classic Arcade Game Clone

In this game the player has to reach the water without running into the enemies (Bugs). The bugs move at different speeds so player should be carful of colliding. 
If the player collides with a Bug the game is reset and begins again. Once the player reaches the water, the game is won and the game resets to begin again.

To move the boy use arrow keys up, down, left, right. 

while researching how to code the JavaScript for app.js many sites where visited and some code from these site may have been used in my project. These sites include Sitepoint,Udemy, and Udacity.
